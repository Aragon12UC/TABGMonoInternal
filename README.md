# TABGMonoInternal
Basic mono internal for TABG. The main goal was performance, you can read my UC post about how to optimise mono internals if it interests you.

# How to build
1. Reference most dlls in <gameDirectory>\TotallyAccurateBattlegrounds_Data\Managed
2. Build

# Features
Magic bullet, Player box esp, Rapid fire guns, infinite ammo, crosshair, player name esp, player chams, vehicle esp, item esp, infinite jumps, speedhack and a basic godmode.

# Detection
I've been using it for 2 days in a row and I haven't gotten banned yet. I HIGHLY recommend you rebuild your own SharpMonoInjector and rename the window title though.

# How to use
Use VollRagm's public EQU8 bypass on a mono injector (the guy's a legend go +rep him): https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/451234-noequ8-cheat-engine-totally-accurate-battlegrounds.html
